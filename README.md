# Dungeons and Dragons (DND) Character Sheet Creator

## Introduction:

1. The purpose of the application is to provide the user with an interface to create character sheet for tabletop RPG DND.
2. To start the program download the repository and launch the `main.py` script.
3. The process of using the program is quite straight forward: fill the labels, choose the desired options for character's characteristics and gain access to the character sheet.

## OOP Principles implementation:

1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is demonstrated throughout the code by using classes to encapsulate related functionality and data. The `Calculations` class encapsulates the logic for computing character statistics, abstracts away the details of data access.
2. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is utilized in the logic of creating windows to create relashionships between classes. The classes `FirstWindow`, `SecondWindow`, `ThirdWindow`, `ForthWindow` and `CharactersWindow` classes inherit from the `Window` class, and the GUI creation logic in `GUIFactory` class is biuld on iheritance.
3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is demonstrated through method overriding and method overloading. Subclasses `LabelComponent`, `EntryComponent`, `DropdownComponent`, `ButtonComponent` override the `create()` method from parant class `GUIComponent` to provide specific implementations.
4. **Abstraction**: Abstraction is used to hide the internal implementation details of classes and expose only relevant functionalities. For instance, the `GUIComponent` class provides an abstract method `create()`, leaving the implementation details to its subclasses.

## Body/Analysis: Functional requirements.

### Design Patterns:
1. **Abstarct Factory**: The `GUIFactory` class acts as a concrete implementation of `AstractFactory` class. Each method in `GUIFactory`
 subclass provides a specific implementation for creating GUI components.
```py
class AbstractFactory(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_label(self, master, text):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def create_entry(self, master):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def create_dropdown(self, master, options, command):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def create_button(self, master, text, command):
        pass


class GUIFactory(AbstractFactory):
    def create_label(self, master, text):
        return LabelComponent().create(master, text=text)

    def create_entry(self, master):
        return EntryComponent().create(master)

    def create_dropdown(self, master, options, command, variable=None):
        return DropdownComponent().create(master, options=options, command=command, variable=variable)

    def create_button(self, master, text, command):
        return ButtonComponent().create(master, text=text, command=command)
```

2. **Builder**: The `CharacterBuilder` class is used as a storage for the data entered by the user, and once filled, its instance is passed around windows.

```py
class CharacterBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = ""
        self.race = ""
        self.character_class = ""
        self.level = 0
        self.background = ""
        self.armour = ""
        self.history = ""
        self.hair = ""

### Reading from File & Writing to File:
The program reads chracacter's characteristics from either the instance of `CharacterBuilder` class or the dictionaries of the instance of `GUIManager` class and writes them into the JSON file using the `DataConservation` class. The file is updated each time the character sheet is updated. The character also can be imported from the .json file using `import` button on first window.

### Testing with unittests:
There are two scripsts for unittests: one checks the functionality of all calculations performed in `Calculations` class and the other one - of `GUIManager` class (creation of GUI elements).
In total there are 16 unittests that cover core functionality.

## Results and Summary

### Results:

1. **Calculations**:
   - Implemented the calculations required for additional character's characteristics based on the fundamental ones.
2. **Character Sheet Generation**:
   - Implemented functionalities for generating character sheets with all recorded details, providing a comprehensive overview of the character's traits and abilities.
3. **Character Data Saving And Changing**:
   - Implemented the functionality of changing and saving the data entered by user into a file. 
4. **Windows Creation**:
   - Implemented the creation of all windows, thier GUI elements and instances interaction.
5. **Events Handling**:
   - Implemented event handling functionalities for responding to user interactions, such as button clicks, dropdown selections, and text input changes.

### Conclusions:

   The application successfully implements core functionalities related to character creation and management, providing a tool for DND players to create and modify their characters' characteristics.
   The character sheet is accesseble after the initial creation, making the program useful in real world scenarios.
   The application follows modular design which allows to easily extend and maintain functionality.
   The application will be extended to allow creation of multiple character sheets and some new not yet implemented parameters such as feats and how the level of character affects the stats. 


### Extensibility:

1. **Multiple Characters**: Introduce new functionality of handling and editing not one but multiple characters (character sheets).
2. **Creation of new windows**: Creating the new subclass for parant class `Window` for each new window. 
3. **Creation of new GUI elements**: By adding the additional subclass into the `GUIComponent` class and new respective method into `GUIFactory` class, the new element could be added.
4. **Creation of additional characteristics**: Can be done through adding characteristic into `CharacterBuilder` class.
